# How to Start Windows in Safe Mode

## 1. The Problem

Windows is crashing on startup, running extremely slowly, or you're experiencing constant pop-ups or BSODs. You suspect a bad driver or malware. You need to start Windows in a basic state to troubleshoot.

## 2. The Solution

Booting into "Safe Mode" starts Windows with only the essential drivers and services. If the computer is stable in Safe Mode, it confirms the problem is a piece of software or a driver you installed.

The easiest way to get to Safe Mode is from the Windows login screen.

1.  On the Windows login screen (or from the Start Menu), click the **Power icon** in the bottom-right corner.
2.  Hold down the **SHIFT** key on your keyboard.
3.  While *still holding SHIFT*, click **Restart**.
4.  The computer will restart and show a blue "Choose an option" screen.
5.  Select **Troubleshoot**.
6.  Select **Advanced options**.
7.  Select **Startup Settings**.
8.  Click the **Restart** button.
9.  The computer will restart again and show a list of options. Press the **`4`** key (or `F4`) to **Enable Safe Mode**.

Your computer will now boot into a basic desktop with a black background. From here, you can uninstall the problematic program or update the faulty driver.
