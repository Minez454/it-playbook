# How to Scan for Malware (Virus)

## 1. The Problem

A user reports their computer is suddenly very slow, they are seeing lots of pop-up ads, their browser homepage changed, or other strange behavior. This is a common sign of a malware infection.

## 2. The Solution

Use the built-in Windows Security (Microsoft Defender) to run a deep scan.

1.  Click the **Start** button and type **"Windows Security"**. Press **Enter**.
2.  In the new window, click on **"Virus & threat protection"**.
3.  Click on **"Scan options"** (a blue link under the "Quick scan" button).
4.  Select **"Full scan"**. This will check every file and running program, but it can take over an hour.
5.  Click the **"Scan now"** button.

### For Serious Infections:

If you suspect the malware is actively hiding, a regular scan might not find it. Use the "Offline Scan".

1.  On the same **"Scan options"** page, select **"Microsoft Defender Offline scan"**.
2.  Click **"Scan now"**.
3.  The computer will warn you that it's about to restart. Save any open work and click **"Scan"**.
4.  The PC will restart and run a special scan *before* Windows fully loads, which makes it much better at finding deeply hidden malware. The process takes about 15 minutes.

If any threats are found, Windows Security will ask you to **"Quarantine"** or **"Remove"** them.
