# How to Troubleshoot a Faulty Keyboard or Mouse

## 1. The Problem

A user's mouse is lagging, jumping, or has stopped moving. Or, a user's keyboard is not typing or is typing the wrong characters.

## 2. The Solution

This is almost always a connection issue.

### Step A: For Wired (USB) Devices

1.  **Unplug and Re-plug:** Ask the user to unplug the device's USB cable and plug it back in. Windows will often make a "ding" sound, showing it has re-detected the device.
2.  **Try a Different Port:** If that fails, ask the user to plug the device into a *different* USB port on their computer. A single USB port can fail.
3.  **Test on Another Device:** If it still doesn't work, plug the mouse or keyboard into a different computer (if available). If it *also* fails on the second computer, the device itself is broken.

### Step B: For Wireless Devices

1.  **Check Batteries:** This is the #1 cause. Ask the user to replace the batteries with a fresh set.
2.  **Check the USB Dongle:** Most wireless devices have a small USB dongle. Ask the user to unplug it, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in (try a different port as well).
3.  **Check Bluetooth:** If it's a Bluetooth device, go to Windows "Settings" > "Bluetooth & devices" and make sure Bluetooth is turned on and the device is listed as "Connected." If not, try to re-pair the device.
