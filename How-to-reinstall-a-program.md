# How to Repair or Reinstall a Corrupt Program

## 1. The Problem

A user reports that a specific application (like Microsoft Word or Outlook) is constantly freezing, crashing, or won't open at all. Other programs seem fine. This suggests the program's own files are corrupt.

## 2. The Solution

You can use the built-in Windows "Repair" function. If that fails, you must fully uninstall and reinstall the program.

### Step A: Try a Repair First

1.  Click the **Start** button and type **"Add or remove programs"**. Press **Enter**.
2.  Scroll down the list and find the program that is broken (e.g., "Microsoft 365 Apps").
3.  Click the three dots (...) next to the name and select **"Modify"**.
4.  A new window will open. Select the **"Quick Repair"** option first and run it.
5.  If "Quick Repair" doesn't fix it, run the **"Online Repair"** (this takes longer and requires an internet connection).

### Step B: If Repair Fails, Reinstall

1.  Go back to **"Add or remove programs"**.
2.  Find the program, click the three dots (...), and select **"Uninstall"**.
3.  Follow the prompts to completely remove the program.
4.  **Restart the computer.** This is a critical step.
5.  Once the computer is back on, go to the official source (e.g., Office.com for Microsoft 365) and download and reinstall a fresh copy of the software.
