# How to Handle a Suspected Phishing Email

## 1. The Problem

A user receives a suspicious email. It might be:
* Asking for their password.
* Claiming they won a prize.
* Using urgent language (e.g., "Your account will be suspended!").
* Coming from a strange-looking email address (e.g., `microsft.support@login-help.com`).

## 2. The Solution

This is a security incident. The goal is to protect the user and the company *without* triggering the malicious link or attachment.

1.  **DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING:** Instruct the user not to click any links, open any attachments, or reply to the email.

2.  **REPORT THE EMAIL:**
    * **In Outlook:** Most companies have a "Report Phishing" button. Instruct the user to select the email and click this button.
    * **Manual Forward:** If no button exists, instruct the user to create a **brand new email** addressed to the IT Security team (e.g., `security@company.com`).
    * Have them **drag and drop** the suspicious email into the new email as an **attachment**. (This preserves the email's headers, which security needs for analysis).

3.  **DELETE THE EMAIL:** After forwarding it to security, instruct the user to **delete** the original phishing email from their Inbox.

4.  **IF THEY CLICKED:** If the user already clicked a link or entered their password, it becomes an emergency.
    * Tell them to **immediately disconnect from the network** (unplug the Ethernet cable or turn off Wi-Fi).
    * Tell them to **immediately change their password** from a different, safe device (like their phone).
    * Escalate the issue to the security team right away.
