# How to Troubleshoot a Computer That Won't Turn On

## 1. The Problem

A user presses the power button on their computer (desktop or laptop), but nothing happens. There are no lights, no beeps, and no fans spinning.

## 2. The Solution

This problem is almost always related to power.

1.  **Check the Wall Outlet:** Ask the user to plug a different, working device (like a lamp or phone charger) into the same wall outlet or power strip to confirm the outlet has power.

2.  **Check the Power Strip:** If using a power strip, make sure the power strip itself is turned on and plugged into the wall. Try plugging the computer directly into the wall, bypassing the strip.

3.  **Check the Power Cable:** Have the user check the computer's power cable.
    * **For a Desktop:** The cable has two ends. Make sure one end is plugged securely into the wall and the other end is plugged securely into the back of the computer's **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**.
    * **For a Laptop:** Check the connection from the wall to the AC adapter (the "brick") and the connection from the brick to the laptop.

4.  **Check the Desktop PSU Switch:** On the back of a desktop computer, the power supply often has a small "I/O" (on/off) rocker switch. Make sure this switch is in the "I" (on) position.

5.  **Test a Different Cable:** If possible, swap the computer's power cable with a known-good one (like from a monitor).

6.  **Laptop Battery:** If it's a laptop, ask the user to unplug the power adapter, remove the battery (if it's removable), hold the power button for 15 seconds, and then plug the power adapter *back in* (without the battery) and try to turn it on.
