# How to Troubleshoot a Monitor with No Display

## 1. The Problem

A user reports their computer is on, but the monitor is black and says "No Signal" or is completely off.

## 2. The Solution

1.  **Check Power:** Ask the user to press the power button on the monitor itself. If it doesn't light up, check the monitor's power cable and make sure it is plugged securely into both the monitor and the wall outlet (or power strip).

2.  **Check Video Cable:** This is the most common fix. Have the user trace the video cable (HDMI, DisplayPort, or VGA) from the monitor to the computer.

3.  **Reseat the Cable:** Ask the user to unplug the video cable from *both* ends (the computer and the monitor) and plug them back in, making sure they are snug.

4.  **Check the Wrong Port:** If it's a desktop computer, make sure the cable is plugged into the **graphics card** (usually horizontal, lower down on the PC tower) and NOT the motherboard (usually vertical, near the USB ports).

5.  **Restart Computer:** If the cable is secure, ask the user to restart the computer.
