# How to Troubleshoot a Wi-Fi Connection

## 1. The Problem

A user reports they cannot connect to the Wi-Fi, or the connection keeps dropping. The Wi-Fi icon in the taskbar might have a globe symbol or show "No Internet, secured".

## 2. The Solution

Start with the simplest solutions first, as this can be a user, computer, or router issue.

1.  **Check if Wi-Fi is On:**
    * Click the Network icon (globe or Wi-Fi symbol) in the taskbar. Make sure the "Wi-Fi" button is blue (on).
    * Check if the laptop has a physical Wi-Fi switch on the side, or a function key (like `F5` or `F12`) that toggles the Wi-Fi adapter.

2.  **Restart the Router:** If *multiple* users in the same area are having issues, the router is the likely problem. Unplug the router's power cable, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in.

3.  **"Forget" and Reconnect:** If it's just one user, their saved password for that network might be corrupt.
    * Go to Windows "Settings" > "Network & internet" > "Wi-Fi".
    * Click "Manage known networks".
    * Find the name of the Wi-Fi network they are trying to join, click it, and select "Forget".
    * Go back to the available networks list, find the network again, and re-enter the password to connect.

4.  **Run the Troubleshooter:**
    * Right-click the network icon in the taskbar.
    * Select "Troubleshoot problems".
    * Follow the on-screen prompts. The Windows troubleshooter is surprisingly good at resetting the network adapter and fixing this issue.
